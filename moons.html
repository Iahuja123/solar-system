    <h2>Moons of Solar System</h2>
    <p>The solar system is home to over 200 known moons, each unique in size, shape, and features. Earth has just one
        moon, but other planets like Jupiter and Saturn have dozens. Jupiter’s Ganymede is the largest moon and even
        bigger than Mercury. Saturn’s moon Titan has thick clouds and lakes of methane. Neptune’s Triton orbits
        backward, which is very rare. Some moons may have underground oceans that could support life. These moons help
        scientists understand how planets formed and how life might exist beyond Earth.</p>

                Earth’s Moon is the fifth-largest moon in the solar system and the only one humans have visited. It has
                a rocky surface covered in craters, mountains, and flat plains called maria, formed by ancient lava
                flows. The Moon has no atmosphere, so temperatures vary widely, and there's no weather. It plays a vital
                role in Earth’s tides due to its gravitational pull. The Moon is about 3,474 km in diameter and orbits
                Earth every 27.3 days. It formed about 4.5 billion years ago, likely from debris after a massive
                collision between Earth and another celestial body.

                Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the solar system. It has a thick,
                orange-colored atmosphere made mostly of nitrogen, with methane and ethane. Its surface is freezing
                cold, around -179°C, and features rivers, lakes, and seas—not of water, but of liquid methane and
                ethane. Titan's icy crust covers a possible subsurface ocean. It’s the only moon known to have a dense
                atmosphere and stable surface liquids, making it one of the most Earth-like places in space. NASA plans
                to explore it further with the Dragonfly drone mission in the coming years.

                Triton is the largest moon of Neptune and one of the most unique moons in the solar system. Unlike most
                moons, it orbits Neptune backward, suggesting it may have been captured from
                the Kuiper Belt. Triton has a very cold surface, with temperatures around -235°C, and is covered in
                nitrogen ice. It has a thin atmosphere and active geysers that shoot nitrogen gas into space, making it
                one of the few moons with signs of activity. Scientists believe Triton might have an ocean beneath its
                icy crust, which could hold clues about life beyond Earth.

                Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and orbits the planet Jupiter. It is even bigger than
                the planet Mercury, with a diameter of about 5,268 kilometers. Ganymede is the only moon known to have
                its own magnetic field, likely created by a liquid iron core. Its surface is a mix of rocky regions
                and icy areas with grooves, showing signs of geological activity. Scientists believe there is a salty
                ocean beneath its icy crust, which might hold conditions suitable for life. Ganymede’s size, magnetic
                field, and possible ocean make it a fascinating target for future exploration.
